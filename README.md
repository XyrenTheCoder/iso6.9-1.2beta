# iso6.9-1.2beta
iso.bot is originally made by notsniped#4573. This is a remix of iso.bot by αrchιshα#5518.

iso6.9 is a Discord bot written in Python and is used to make your Discord experience better! It is similar to iso.bot as it is a remix.

Its prefix is `]`.

# Insert token and id before running the code. 
To run it, put the bot token inside:

> token = "token"

Also put your discord id in:

> cid = "client_id"

To get your id, run `?userinfo` or `auserinfo` (slash commands also works) in any servers with Dyno or Arcane and copy your bot's client ID.
