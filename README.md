# iso6.9-1.2beta
iso.bot is originally made by notsniped#0002. This is a remix of iso.bot by αrchιshα#5518.

iso6.9 is a Discord bot written in Python and is used to make your Discord experience better! It is similar to iso.bot as it is a remix.

Its prefix is `]`. 

# Insert token and id before running the code 
To run it, go to line 15 and put the bot token inside 

> token = "token_line_15"

Also put your discord id in line 16. 

To get your id, run `?userinfo` or `auserinfo` (slash commands also works) in any servers with Dyno or Arcane and copy your bot's client ID.
